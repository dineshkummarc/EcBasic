EcBasic ("E-commerce Basic") started from github.com/alexpercsi/ecommerce, which included comments about suggested
changes. The original ecommerce SproutCore app was done by Alex Percsi and a colleague (github.com/razvan-jurca/eCommerce)
as part of a training exercise. I read the comments and made quite a few suggested changes, and also moved code out of
controllers and into the models, added a statechart, more controllers, etc. This repo does not show history changes from
the original, because it was developed in a private repo for a while and then dumped out before a final round of changes
were made as a separate app. You may wish to look at the version in github.com/alexpercsi/ecommerce for comments (will
need to translate from Romanian, if you don't speak that language).

I presently don't need to develop this app further, but perhaps we can fix/move it along, if only as another simple example
SproutCore app. Or somebody may need to develop it for a real web storefront.
